#### Socket.IO
Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
#### WebRTC
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary.<br>
WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this.
